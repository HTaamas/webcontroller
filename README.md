# HTaamas's Minecraft Web Terminal (HMWT)

This is a very simple minecraft web terminal with some pre programmed buttons and features

It was a school project of mine(hence its in hungarian) that i really liked and continued the development of it 

## Planned things:
- Login/multiuser panel
- English language
- maybe a working cpu usuage displayer
- and much more...
